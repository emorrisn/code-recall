# Code Recall

Code Recall empowers you to set personalised messages, ensuring that each time you reopen the editor, you're gently reminded of your last focus and tasks, creating a seamless transition back into your coding flow.

## Features

Save quick reminders with a click of a button and receive automatic pop-ups when you reopen your editor.  

A button will appear on the bottom bar of your editor, useful for when you're about to exit from the editor and finish your work.

Once loaded, if you have a message set from the previous coding session, you will recieve a notification that looks like this:
